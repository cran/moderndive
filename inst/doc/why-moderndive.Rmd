## Intro

Linear regression has long been a staple of introductory statistics courses. While the timing of when to introduce it may have changed (many argue that descriptive regression should be done ASAP and then revisited later after statistical inference has been covered), it's overall importance in the intro stats curriculum remains the same.

Let's consider data gathered from end of semester student evaluations for 463 professors from the University of Texas at Austin (see [openintro.org](https://www.openintro.org/stat/data/?data=evals){target="_blank"} for more details). Here is a random sample of 5 instructors and a subset of 8 of the 13 variables included, where the outcome variable of interest is the teaching evaluation `score` out of 5 as given by students: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(moderndive)
library(knitr)
evals %>% 
  select(ID, score, age, bty_avg, gender, ethnicity, language, rank) %>% 
  sample_n(5) %>% 
  kable()
```

The data is included in `evals` dataset in the [`moderndive`](https://moderndive.github.io/moderndive/){target="_blank"} R package for tidyverse-friendly introductory linear regression. Let's fit a regression model of teaching `score` as a function of instructor `age`:

```{r}
library(moderndive)
score_model <- lm(score ~ age, data = evals)
```

### Regression analysis the "good old-fashioned" way

Let's analyze the output of the fitted model `score_model` "the good old fashioned way": using `summary.lm()`.

```{r}
summary(score_model)
```

Here are five common student comments/questions we've heard over the years in our intro stats courses based on this output:

1. "Wow! Look at those p-value stars! Stars are good, so I must get more stars somehow."
1. "How do extract the values in the regression table?"
1. "Where are the fitted/predicted values and residuals?"
1. "How do I apply this model to a new set of data to make predictions?"
1. "What is all this other stuff at the bottom?"

### Regression analysis the tidyverse-friendly way

To address these comments/questions, we've included three functions in the `moderndive` package that takes as a fitted model as input (in this case `score_model`) and returns the same information as `summary(score_model)` but in a tidyverse-friendly way:

1. Get a tidy regression table **with** confidence intervals:
    ```{r}
    get_regression_table(score_model)
    ```
2. Get information on each point/observation in your regression, including fitted/predicted values & residuals, in a single data frame:
    ```{r}
    get_regression_points(score_model)
    ```
3. Get scalar summaries of a regression fit including $R^2$ and $R^2_{adj}$ but also the (root) mean-squared error:
    ```{r}
    get_regression_summaries(score_model)
    ```


### Why should you use the `moderndive` package?

We think that these three functions included in the `moderndive` package are effective pedagogical tools that can help address the above five common student comments/questions. Why now argue why.


------


## 1. Less p-value stars, more confidence intervals

The first common student comment/question:

> "Wow! Look at those p-value stars! Stars are good, so I must get more stars somehow."

We argue that the `summary()` output is deficient in an intro stats setting because:

* The `Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1` only encourage **p-hacking**. In case you have not yet been convinced of the perniciousness of p-hacking, perhaps comedian [John Oliver can convince you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rnq1NpHdmw){target="_blank"}.  
* While not a silver bullet for eliminating misinterpretations of statistical inference results, confidence intervals at least give students a sense of the practical significance and not just the statistical significance of the results. These should be included in the regression table output.

Instead of `summary()`, let's use the `get_regression_table()` function in the `moderndive` package:

```{r}
get_regression_table(score_model)
```

Confidence intervals! By including them in the output, we can easily emphasize to students that they "surround" the point estimates in the `estimate` column. Note the confidence level is defaulted to 95%. 


------


## 2. Outputs as tidy tibbles!

All the functions in the `moderndive` package return tidy tibbles! So for example, by piping the above `get_regression_table(score_model)` output into the `kable()` function from the `knitr` package, you can have aesthetically pleasing regression tables in R Markdown documents, instead of jarring computer output font:

```{r}
get_regression_table(score_model) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

Now let's address the second common student comment/question:

> "How do extract the values in the regression table?"

While one might argue that extracting the intercept and slope coefficients can be simply done using `coefficients(score_model)`, what about the standard errors? A Google query of "_how do I extract standard errors from lm in r_" yields results from [the R mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2008-April/160538.html){target="_blank"} and from [crossvalidated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/27511/extract-standard-errors-of-coefficient-linear-regression-r){target="_blank"} suggesting we run:

```{r}
sqrt(diag(vcov(score_model)))
```

Say what?!? It shouldn't be this hard! However since `get_regression_table()` returns a data frame/tidy tibble, you can easily extract columns using `dplyr::pull()`:

```{r}
get_regression_table(score_model) %>% 
  pull(std_error)
```

or equivalently you can use the `$` sign operator from base R:

```{r}
get_regression_table(score_model)$std_error
```


------


## 3. Birds of a feather should flock together: Fitted values & residuals

The third common student comment/question:

> "Where are the fitted/predicted values and residuals?"

How can we extract point-by-point information from a regression model, such as the fitted/predicted values and the residuals? (Note we'll only display the first 10 of such values, and not all n = 463, for brevity's sake)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fitted(score_model)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
fitted(score_model)[1:10]
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
residuals(score_model)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
residuals(score_model)[1:10]
```

But why have the original explanatory/predictor `age` and outcome variable `score` in `evals`, the fitted/predicted values `score_hat`, and `residual` floating around in separate pieces? Since each observation relates to the same instructor, wouldn't it make sense to organize them together? This is where `get_regression_points()` shines!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
get_regression_points(score_model)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
get_regression_points(score_model) %>% 
  slice(1:10)
```

Observe that the original outcome variable `score` and explanatory/predictor variable `age` are now supplemented with the fitted/predicted value `score_hat` and `residual` columns. By putting the fitted/predicted values and the residuals next to the original data, we argue that the computation of these values is less opaque. For example in class, instructors can write out by hand how all the values in the first row, corresponding to the first instructor, are computed. 

Furthermore, recall that all outputs in the `moderndive` package are data frames/tidy tibbles, thus you can easily create custom residual analysis plots, instead of the default ones yielded by `plot(score_model)`. For example, we create:

* A histogram of all residuals to investigate normality.
* A *partial residual plot* of the relationship of the residuals vs all explanatory/predictor variables to investigate the presence of heteroskedasticity; in this case a scatterplot of the residuals over `age`.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
score_model_points <- get_regression_points(score_model)

# Histogram of residuals:
ggplot(score_model_points, aes(x = residual)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of residuals")

# Investigating patterns:
ggplot(score_model_points, aes(x = age, y = residual)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Residuals over age")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.width=16/2.2, fig.height=9/2.2}
score_model_points <- get_regression_points(score_model)

# Histogram of residuals:
ggplot(score_model_points, aes(x = residual)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of residuals")

# Investigating patterns:
ggplot(score_model_points, aes(x = age, y = residual)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Residuals over age")
```

## 4. Baby's first Kaggle predictive modeling competition submission!

The fourth common student comment/question:

> "How do I apply this model to a new set of data to make predictions?"

With the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence gaining prominence, the importance of predictive modeling cannot be understated. Therefore, we've designed the `get_regression_points()` function to allow for a `newdata` argument to quickly apply a previously fitted model to "new" observations. 

Let's create an artificial "new" dataset which is a subset of the original `evals` data with the outcome variable `score` removed and use it as the `newdata` argument:

```{r}
new_evals <- evals %>% 
  sample_n(4) %>% 
  select(-score)
new_evals

get_regression_points(score_model, newdata = new_evals)
```

`score_hat` are the predicted values! Let's do another example, this time using the Kaggle [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques){target="_blank"} practice competition.

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("kaggle.png")
```

This Kaggle competition requires you to fit/train a model to the provided `train.csv` training set to make predictions of house prices in the provided `test.csv` test set. Here is code for a "baby's first Kaggle competition" submission that will:

1. Read in the training and test data (that we posted on GitHub).
1. Fit a naive model of house sale price as a function of year sold.
1. Write a `submission.csv` file that can be submitted to Kaggle. Note the use of the `ID` argument to indicate that a variable identifying each observational unit/row should be included. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)

# Load in training and test set
train <- read_csv("https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive/raw/master/vignettes/train.csv")
test <- read_csv("https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive/raw/master/vignettes/test.csv")

# Fit model
house_model <- lm(SalePrice ~ YrSold, data = train)

# Make and submit predictions
submission <- get_regression_points(house_model, newdata = test, ID = "Id") %>% 
  select(Id, SalePrice = SalePrice_hat)
write_csv(submission, "submission.csv")
```

Submitting `submission.csv` to the leaderboard for this Kaggle competition we
get a "root mean squared logarithmic error" score of 0.42918, where smaller
scores are better:

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("leaderboard_orig.png")
```

## 5. Scalar summaries of linear regression model fits

The fifth common student comment/question:

> "What is all this other stuff at the bottom?"

Going back to the `summary()` from above, we figured it would be nice to be able to extract all the scalar summaries linear regression model fits. We've supplemented the standard scalar summaries output yielded by `summary()` with the mean squared error `mse` and root mean squared error `rmse` given their popularity in machine learning settings:

```{r}
get_regression_summaries(score_model)
```


------


## The Details

The three `get_regression` functions are wrappers of functions from the [`broom`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=broom/vignettes/broom.html){target="_blank"} package for converting statistical analysis objects into tidy tibbles along with a few added tweaks:

1. `get_regression_table()` is a wrapper for `broom::tidy()`
1. `get_regression_points()` is a wrapper for `broom::augment()`
1. `get_regression_summaries` is a wrapper for `broom::glance()`

Why did we take this approach to address the 5 common student questions/comments at the outset of the article?

* By writing wrappers to pre-existing functions, instead of creating new custom functions, there is minimal "re-inventing the wheel" necessary. 
* The `broom` package function names `tidy()`, `augment()`, and `glance()` don't mean anything to intro stats students, where as the `moderndive` package function names `get_regression_table()`, `get_regression_points()`, and `get_regression_summaries()` are more intuitive.
* The default column/variable names in the outputs of the above 3 functions are a little daunting for intro stats students to interpret. We cut out some of them and renamed many of them with more intuitive names. For example, compare the outputs of the `get_regression_points()` wrapper function and the parent `broom::augment()` function.

```{r}
get_regression_points(score_model)
broom::augment(score_model)
```

If you're curious to see how we designed these 3 functions, take a look at the source code on  [GitHub](https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive/blob/master/R/regression_functions.R){target="_blank"}!
